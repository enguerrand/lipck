About
-----

lipck is a helper tool for remastering Ubuntu based distributions. Amongst
others it can
- apply patches to rootfs/isofs/initramfs,
- update the initramfs kernel,
- preinstall packages into the rootfs,
- provide a custom package archive on the install media; this allows a user
  to install extra packages without internet access,
- merge i386 and amd64 install media (including file deduplication and
  automated architecture recognition in grub),
- autogenerate grub configuration from templates.

In comparison to other tools, like UCK, the host system is independent of the
system remastered. Furthermore, the host is kept clean with respect to resources
(like mount points). This is achieved by using linux namespaces/lxc.

However, in its current state each version of lipck (git tag/commit) is designed
for a specific Ubuntu version. While the version/source image can be configured
freely, patches and static files (i.e. those in the contrib directory) are
not versionized and do only apply to a single Ubuntu image.

Originally, lipck was (or still is) created to remaster install images for
linux install fests organized by members of the Open Source Arbeitskreis of
the Fachschaft 1/1 Mathematik, Physik, Informatik of the RWTH Aachen University.
It is published in hope that it will be useful for someone else as well.
