This is lipck - the "linux install party customization kit".

This package of scripts is intended for remastering Ubuntu based 
distributions.
This collection of scripts was created by members of the
Open-Source working group of the Fachschaft 1/1 Mathematik, Physik,
Informatik of the RWTH Aachen University for remastering images for their
Linux Install Parties.
Existing solutions such as UCK could not do some things we wanted to do like 
updating the initramfs kernel, saving space by deduplicating files between
multiple architectures (e.g. x86,x64). We release this collection of scripts
in hope that they will be useful for someone else as well.
