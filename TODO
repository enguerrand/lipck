- Build the offline repository automatically
  WiP: offline_repo branch

- Documentation containing
  - an explanation of the structure of the original
    and the remastered image,
  - a coarse overview of the remaster process and
    the changes introduced:
    What do we want to achieve with lipck?,
  - and a deep documentation of the single steps,
    e.g. target wise.

- aptitude triggers the "set -e" in remaster_rootfs
  Known workaround: comment the "set -e"

- Solve the lxc.init problem (no lxc.init available in Ubuntu rootfs
  but it is required to install stuff inside the rootfs...)
  Implemented workaround: create on-the-fly a bash script, name it
  lxc.init.static and hope the best.

- Rootless remastering. Requirements:
  - user namespaces
  - loop devices inside a user container
  - device mapper inside a user container
